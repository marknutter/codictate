# Codictate domain glossary

Canonical terms for Codictate. Glossary only: no implementation details, no plans, no decisions. Architectural decisions live in `docs/adr/`, architecture in `AGENTS.md`.

## Dictation

**Dictation** - one complete cycle of the core user action: the user activates a Dictation Shortcut, speaks, and the resulting text is placed at the cursor.

**Dictation Plan** - the fully resolved description of what a single Dictation will do: which Speech Engine and Speech Model run it, in which Transcription Language, whether Translate to English applies, and whether it is a Live Transcription. A Dictation Plan is either runnable or blocked. Codictate never adapts a Dictation to an unrunnable state - it keeps the state runnable instead - so a blocked plan means something changed outside the app, and it names the reason rather than starting a Dictation that cannot do what was asked.

**Dictation Outcome** - what a finished Batch Dictation produced: the Raw Transcript, the text after the Dictionary and the Formatting Mode were applied, and a record of which Speech Engine and Transcription Language actually ran it. A Dictation Outcome is a value handed back to whatever started the Dictation; placing the text at the cursor is that caller's job, not the run's. Live Transcription produces one too: its staged text goes through the same pipeline when it ends. See `docs/adr/0006-dictation-returns-an-outcome.md` and `docs/adr/0008-live-transcription-stages-in-an-overlay.md`.

**Dictation Shortcut** - the key combination that starts and ends a Dictation. Codictate has two independent slots: the primary shortcut (supports both Hold and Tap) and an optional second shortcut (Hold only).

**Preset** - one of the fixed, named key combinations Codictate offers in the shortcut picker. Codictate does not let a user invent arbitrary combinations; the offered set is curated. See `docs/adr/0003-shortcut-presets-over-capture.md`.

**Trigger Key** - the non-modifier key in a Preset (Space, Enter, F1). A Preset may have no Trigger Key, in which case the combination is modifier-only (Right Option alone, Fn alone, Ctrl+Win).

**Modifier** - Option/Alt, Control, Shift, Command/Win, or Fn. Left and right variants of the same Modifier are distinguishable and are never mixed within one Preset.

**Shortcut Family** - the grouping a Preset appears under in the picker: Option/Alt, Fn/Globe, Control, or Meta (Command on macOS, Win on Windows). A Preset that involves the Meta key groups under Meta whichever Modifier comes first, because Meta is the key a user scans for; every other Preset groups by its leading Modifier.

**Hold** - activation style where the user keeps the Dictation Shortcut pressed while speaking; releasing it ends the Dictation and pastes.

**Tap** (also **latch**) - activation style where a quick press and release starts a hands-free Dictation that continues until the shortcut is pressed a second time.

## Speech

**Speech Engine** - the recognition system a Dictation is transcribed by, as the user sees it: Whisper, Parakeet, or hviske. Note that the Parakeet engine is identified as `whisperkit` in code, which is a misnomer; the engine is FluidAudio.

**hviske** - the Danish-only Speech Engine, running the mirrored `syvai/hviske-v5-tiny` weights. A Speech Engine in its own right rather than a Whisper Speech Model, because its weights, its backend and its language support all differ. See `docs/adr/0004-hviske-danish-ungated.md`.

**ASR Harness** - the specific binary and CLI contract used to execute a Speech Engine. There is one Harness, `crispasr`, and it executes both Whisper and hviske. Harness is an internal concept and is never exposed to end users. See `docs/adr/0002-asr-harness-abstraction.md`.

**Speech Engine Adapter** - the uniform way Codictate asks any Speech Engine for a transcription, so that a caller does not need to know whether the answer comes from an ASR Harness or from a Native Helper. Covers Batch Dictation only: Live Transcription is a session rather than a question, so it is not asked through an Adapter.

**Transcription Request** - one question put to a Speech Engine Adapter: transcribe this audio, with these weights, in this language, translating or not. Deliberately narrower than a Dictation Plan, because the speech benchmark asks the same question without any of a Dictation's settings behind it.

**Transcription Result** - the answer to a Transcription Request: either a Raw Transcript, or a named reason the Speech Engine produced none. A Speech Engine that exits without transcribing is a failure with a reason, never an empty transcript treated as speech.

**Speech Model** - the weights a Speech Engine loads, identified by a Model ID (`large-v3-turbo-q5_0`). Distinct from the Speech Engine that runs it and the Harness that executes it. In code and in the persisted config the selection is `speechModelId`; `whisperModelId` was its name until it held hviske and Parakeet ids too, and survives only as a key an old config file is still read from.

**Quantization** - the precision variant of a Speech Model (`q4_k`, `q5_0`, `f16`). Different Quantizations of the same weights are separate Speech Models with separate Model IDs.

**Curated Speech Model** - a Speech Model Codictate offers in the main Settings list. Everything else is reachable only through the browse modal ("Browse more models" in Settings). Curation is a recommendation Codictate stands behind, not a capability difference.

**Transcription Language** - the language the user has fixed for recognition, or automatic detection.

**Translate to English** - a mode where the Speech Engine outputs English regardless of the spoken language, rather than transcribing verbatim. Distinct from Transcription Language, which selects the input language.

**Live Transcription** - a mode where partial text appears in the Staging Overlay while the user is still speaking, and is pasted once when the Dictation ends. Requires Parakeet, and a Transcription Language that Parakeet supports. Parakeet detects the spoken language itself, so the user does not choose one: the Transcription Language is automatic for the whole time Parakeet is the selected Speech Model. Previously labelled "Stream mode".

**Staging Overlay** - the floating panel that shows a Live Transcription's running text. Nothing reaches the focused app until the Dictation ends. It is the recording indicator grown into a text panel, and never takes focus. See `docs/adr/0008-live-transcription-stages-in-an-overlay.md`.

**Scratch Command** - the spoken phrase "scratch that", which removes itself and the phrase before it from the transcript. A text rule, not a model.

## Formatting

**Raw Transcript** - the text a Speech Engine produced, before any rewriting.

**Formatting Mode** - a named rewriting behaviour applied to a Raw Transcript before it is pasted (for example turning spoken words into an email). "Off" is a Formatting Mode.

**Self-correction Cleanup** - an optional step that resolves spoken self-corrections ("at three, no, four" becomes "at four") using the selected Formatting Model, after the Dictionary and before the Formatting Mode. Distinct from a Formatting Mode, which changes how the text reads rather than what it says.

**Formatting Backend** - what executes a Formatting Mode: llama.cpp running a local model, or Apple Intelligence on macOS 26+.

**Formatting Model** - the model the user selects to rewrite a transcript, such as Qwen or S1-mini by Superwhisper. Distinct from the Formatting Mode, which describes the requested writing behaviour, and the Speech Model, which recognises speech.

**Tone** - how casual or formal the rewritten text should read, chosen separately for each Formatting Mode (Messages, Slack, Document). Onboarding asks for one overall Tone and seeds each mode's Tone from it; the user can diverge per mode afterwards. Distinct from Writing Style.

**Writing Style** - the single, global casual-to-formal setting for the S1-mini Formatting Model. Applies across all Formatting Modes and has its own scale, so it is not interchangeable with a Tone.

## Distribution

**Vendor Binary** - a third-party executable Codictate ships and invokes as a subprocess (`crispasr`, `llama-completion`). Distinct from a **Native Helper**, which is a binary Codictate itself authors (`KeyListener`, `CodictateWindowsHelper`, `CodictateParakeetHelper`, `CodictateWindowHelper`, `CodictateObserverHelper`).

**Mirror** - a copy of a third-party Speech Model that Codictate hosts itself, because the upstream repository is access-gated and end users cannot download from it directly.

## Benchmarking

**Benchmark Run** - one named, timestamped execution of the speech benchmark, recorded as a single result file with the hardware it ran on.

**Benchmark Combination** - one (Harness, Speech Model, dataset, language) tuple. "Already benchmarked" is a property of a Combination, not of a Speech Model.

**Sample** - one utterance from a dataset. Sample count is recorded per Combination, so the same Combination can exist at different depths across Benchmark Runs.

**Sample Cursor** - how many of a dataset's ordered clips one Benchmark Combination has already been measured on, as an integer offset. Derived from the `sampleRange` each result leaf records, never hand-maintained. `--samples N` is a delta from it, so sessions accumulate and no clip is ever measured twice.

**Warmup Reservation** - the first three entries of every dataset's ordered manifest, replayed at the start of every (Speech Model, dataset) session to warm the model. Never scored, and never consumed by the Sample Cursor.

**Manifest Fingerprint** - a stable hash of a dataset's ordered clip-ID list, stored beside every recorded range. A Sample Cursor offset is meaningful only against the ordering it was recorded under, so a mismatch stops the Benchmark Run.
