/**
 * Keeping the settings runnable.
 *
 * Validity is a property of the whole settings object, not of the patch being written:
 * turning Translate to English on with a translate-capable Speech Model and then switching
 * to one that cannot translate is two individually valid writes with an invalid result. And
 * validity depends on files, which change with no settings write at all. So the same
 * function runs in three places - on every settings write, on every availability change, and
 * at boot - and it is a pure function of `(settings, availability snapshot)` with no
 * `modelManager`, no platform probe and no filesystem, which is what lets it be tested
 * without either.
 *
 * The write path and the availability path use it differently, on purpose (ADR-0005):
 *
 * - **On write, refuse.** A patch that asks for something that cannot run is rejected whole,
 *   because the user is standing right there and can fix it.
 * - **On an availability change, heal.** Never argue with someone deleting multi-gigabyte
 *   weights to get their disk space back. Correct the configuration instead, and say so.
 *
 * Announcements are limited to the things the user chose deliberately - the Speech Model
 * selection, Translate to English, Live Transcription, and Self-correction Cleanup (healed
 * by its own pure rule in self-correction-cleanup.ts, because it depends on the Formatting
 * Model rather than on anything in this slice). The rest is corrected in silence. Silently flipping a toggle the user set is the same class of surprise as a silent
 * fallback, so the noisy set and the quiet set are drawn on purpose rather than by
 * convenience.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0005-no-runtime-fallbacks-for-dictation.md.
