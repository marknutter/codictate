/**
 * The run decision for a Dictation, in both tenses.
 *
 * `buildDictationPlan` is the future tense: it turns `(settings, availability snapshot)`
 * into a **Dictation Plan** - one value naming the Speech Model, Speech Engine, crispasr
 * backend and Transcription Language that a press will actually run, or the closed reason
 * it will run nothing. Batch Dictation and Live Transcription are one union.
 * `getDictationReadiness` is the present tense: the same rule, per capability, as plain
 * serialisable data shipped in the settings payload so the window can disable an option
 * with a sentence before anyone presses anything.
 *
 * Pure functions over `(settings, availability)` only - no filesystem, no platform probe,
 * no `modelManager` - because both the main process and the webview import this module.
 * Availability arrives as an `isModelAvailable(id)` predicate so the caller owns the
 * question of what "installed" means on its side.
 *
 * There is no substitution anywhere below, and no silent drop. A Dictation never adapts to
 * an unrunnable state: the state is kept runnable by `settings-heal.ts`, and the one case
 * that gets past it - weights deleted behind the app's back - produces a blocked plan that
 * names its reason and starts nothing.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0005-no-runtime-fallbacks-for-dictation.md.
