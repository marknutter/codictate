/**
 * Parakeet's one-time on-device preparation, and the single place that decides when it runs.
 *
 * Parakeet (FluidAudio) compiles its weights for the machine that will run them before the
 * first transcription can start, and that compile takes a minute or two. It used to be the
 * user's problem: a readiness reason nobody could act on, a Settings hint warning that the
 * app "may look stuck", and three uncoordinated callers each deciding for themselves whether
 * to prepare. ADR-0005 takes it out of the user-facing set - preparation starts as soon as
 * Parakeet becomes the selected Speech Model, so nobody is asked to wait for something they
 * were never told had started.
 *
 * Two rules make that safe:
 *
 * - **One preparation at a time.** Selection changes fire repeatedly, and boot, a settings
 *   write and a finished download can all want a preparation at once. Two overlapping
 *   compiles are two processes racing over the same files, so `ensureParakeetWarm` is
 *   idempotent: it joins the in-flight preparation rather than starting a second one.
 * - **A Dictation started mid-preparation waits for it.** `awaitParakeetWarmup` is what the
 *   run path calls before it spawns the helper. Waiting is honest here - the wait *is* the
 *   compile, which the run would have paid for itself anyway - and serialising it is what
 *   stops a press racing the preparation and coming back with nothing.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0005-no-runtime-fallbacks-for-dictation.md.
