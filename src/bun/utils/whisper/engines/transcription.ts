/**
 * The Speech Engine Adapter contract: a **Transcription Request** in, a **Transcription
 * Result** out.
 *
 * One interface, two implementations (crispasr and the Parakeet Native Helper) and two
 * callers (the Dictation pipeline and the benchmark). It knows nothing about the Dictionary,
 * Formatting Modes, history or the clipboard, and it takes its audio as a parameter rather
 * than reading `RECORDING_PATH` - which is what stopped a Benchmark Run from copying every
 * Sample over the running app's recording buffer.
 *
 * A Request is deliberately not a Dictation Plan. AGENTS.md keeps the benchmark away from
 * settings, availability healing and the plan, and a Request keeps that true without giving
 * the benchmark a private entry point: the app derives one from its plan through
 * `transcriptionRequestFromPlan` below, the benchmark constructs one by hand.
 *
 * This module is pure - no spawn, no filesystem, no platform probe - so the derivation and
 * the failure sentences are covered by the default `bun test` run. The spawning lives in
 * `crispasr-engine.ts` and `parakeet-engine.ts`.
 *
 * Live Transcription is outside this interface on purpose: it is a session the Parakeet
 * Native Helper streams events from, not one request with one result. Its staged text joins
 * the Dictation pipeline after the engine, in `outcomeFromTranscript`. See
 * docs/adr/0006-dictation-returns-an-outcome.md and
 * docs/adr/0008-live-transcription-stages-in-an-overlay.md.
