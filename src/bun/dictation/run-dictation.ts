/**
 * The Dictation pipeline: a runnable Dictation Plan and either a captured WAV or a staged
 * transcript in, a **Dictation Outcome** out.
 *
 * It does not paste. A transcript could not be obtained from Codictate without pasting it
 * into whatever app had focus, which is what made history, stats and the clipboard the mic
 * module's problem and left the benchmark unable to reuse any of this. Paste, history, stats
 * and the four failure surfaces belong to `setup-recording.ts`, which already owns every
 * other post-Dictation surface. See docs/adr/0006-dictation-returns-an-outcome.md.
 *
 * Nothing here is decided. The Speech Model, the Speech Engine, the crispasr backend, the
 * Transcription Language and the translate flag were all resolved once when the plan was
 * built (ADR-0005), and the audio is a parameter rather than the process-global
 * `RECORDING_PATH`. What is left is the order of the rewrites: the shipped brand table, the
 * user Dictionary, then the Formatting Mode.
 *
 * Two entries, one pipeline. `runDictation` is a Batch Dictation: it asks the Speech Engine
 * for a transcript and hands it on. `outcomeFromTranscript` is everything after the engine, and
 * Live Transcription enters there with the text it staged while the user spoke - the Parakeet
 * Native Helper already transcribed it, so asking an engine again would discard what the user
 * watched appear. Both reach the Dictionary and the Formatting Mode through the same code.
 * See docs/adr/0008-live-transcription-stages-in-an-overlay.md.
